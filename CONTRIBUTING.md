# Contributing Guidelines

You are welcome to post feature requests, bug reports, and pull requests!

For pull requests, follow these guidelines:

* Add tests for any new features and bug fixes. Ideally, each PR should increase the test coverage.
* Add comments into the code wherever necessary.
* Fork the project on your GitHub user account, do your changes in a new branch and then create a PR against main zaap_foo repository.
* Separate unrelated changes into multiple pull requests.
